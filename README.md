# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-Path-Planning
Dijkstra Algorithm for path planning 

Steps to Run the code:

1. Download the file "dijkstra_rohitreddy_pakhala.py" file in your editor
2. Run the code, enter '0' when you see the map
3. Give the x and y input coordinates separately in the terminal.  
ex: Enter the start position..
    Enter your value for x-axis: ('enter value here')
    Similarlly with y-axis and goal position
4.The video .mp4 files is created in the location of the folder 



Libraries used:
1. Numpy: used for basic linear algrbra, mathematical logics, arrays. 
2. cv2: this is a computer vision library, open cv functions
3. Heapq: used for various operations on a heap data structure.
